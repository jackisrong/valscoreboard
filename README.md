## Development
1. Run `npm install` in the root directory
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store tokens
3. Run `npm run start` to (re)register all commands in all Discord servers and then start the bot. Can also run `node deploy-commands.js` to only register commands or `node index.js` to only run the bot.
